Glues is a Vim-inspired TUI note-taking app with Git and MongoDB support - privacy-focused and sync-enabled.
I am excited to announce the release of Glues v0.4.0!
This version brings significant new features and enhancements to improve your note-taking experience.

# ðŸŒŠ New Features
## ðŸš€ MongoDB Storage Support
Added MongoDB note data storage support: You can now store your notes using MongoDB, offering centralized data management. This adds to our existing storage options:
- **Instant**: Notes are maintained only while the app is open.
- **Local**: Notes are stored locally without remote synchronization.
- **Git**: Notes are stored locally and synchronized with a remote Git repository.
- **MongoDB**: Notes are stored on a remote MongoDB database.

## ðŸ’¡ Vim-Inspired Features
- **Added Vim-inspired commands**: I have integrated various Vim commands to enhance your editing experience. You can switch between normal and visual modes, and use common Vim commands for navigation and editing.
- **Keymap Dialog**: Press Ctrl+h in any mode to open a keymap dialog showing available commands in the current mode.
Editor Line Number Feature
- **Toggle Line Numbers**: You can now display line numbers in the editor for easier navigation and reference.
