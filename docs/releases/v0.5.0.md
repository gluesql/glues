# ðŸŒŠ New Features

## ðŸš€ Editor Tabs

Introducing editor tabs! You can now navigate multiple open notes seamlessly with the new tab functionality. Use `tl` in Vim normal mode to switch to the next tab, `th` to go to the previous tab, and `tx` to close the current tab. This significantly enhances multitasking and organization within your notes.

## ðŸ›  Improvements & Fixes

Open Note Key Binding: Changed the open note key binding from o to l for a more intuitive workflow.

Yank Sharing: Yank text is now preserved across notes within a NotebookContext, and yank sharing works correctly across tabs.

Note Management: Fixed the issue where note tree numbering was reset upon certain key inputs (j, k etc.). Also, the rename prompt now shows the current name as the default value for easier editing.
