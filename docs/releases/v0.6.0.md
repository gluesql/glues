Hello everyone. I've been using Glues as my main note-taking app, and I'm pleased to share this update. Here's a brief look at what's new. Expect more improvements soon!

## Main Highlights

### Design Renewal
- **256-Color Support**  
  Switched from just 16 ANSI colors to 256 colors. Everything now looks way more vibrant and consistent, no matter which terminal you’re using.

- **Better Note Tree Browser**  
  - Added Nerd Font icons for directories and notes, so it’s easier to see what’s what at a glance.  
  - Directories get a neat yellow icon, and notes have dimmer icons for contrast.

- **New Bottom Status Area**  
  - Shows Vim mode (Normal/Insert/Visual) on the bottom-left corner.  
  - Displays a breadcrumb to let you know exactly where you are.  
  - Hides the Vim mode label when no tabs are open—clean and simple.

### Keymap Side Panel
- Press `?` to toggle a handy panel on the right with **all** the key mappings.  
- No more cramming everything into a single top row. Now you can open/close the panel anytime you want.

## Additional Improvements
- **Tab Closing Tweaks**: You can now close all tabs on the right or all on the left.  
- **Cleaner Tab Rendering**: Removed the square brackets around editor tabs.  
- **“Saving…” Label Update**: Redesigned for better visibility.  
- **OS Clipboard Integration**: Yanked text goes straight to your system clipboard.  
- **Vim ‘a’ Command Fix**: Properly inserts text at the end of a line.  
- **Rust Update**: Bumped to version 1.84.  
- Plus various refactoring and logging upgrades under the hood.

Hope you find these changes helpful! I’m loving it so far and will keep improving Glues for everyone. Enjoy!
